OMG, just finished watching Control Freak, and honestly, it’s like... what did I even sign up for? I mean, like, one minute I'm vibing, and the next, it's just this massive rollercoaster of “WTF just happened?” Seriously, have you seen it yet? Lemme tell you, prepare to have your mind kinda scrambled. 

You know how sometimes you just download the movie because everyone’s talking about it, and then you realize you’ve been living under a rock for not watching it sooner? Yeah, that’s me right now. I’m like, why didn’t anybody warn me about the brain melt this thing comes with? It’s like all those crazy plot twists wrapped up into this one chaotic package, lol.

> There’s this scene where I was literally on the edge of my seat, and then BOOM, the unexpected happens, and I just couldn’t and wouldn’t believe it. It’s like, come on, does that even make sense? Or am I just a control freak myself for wanting things to be somewhat predictable for once? 🙃

And then there are these characters that are sooo over the top, which is cool, I guess, but I’m left thinking, like, “Do these people even exist in real life or are they just figments of someone’s overly vivid imagination?” 😂 Anyway, character development was pretty, let's just say, unique.

Speaking of which, when are we doing our next movie night? We should so totally watch the movie together and laugh at all the insane stuff, right? I mean, get your popcorn ready 'cause this film is both a trip and a half. You’ll be like, “Dude, what even is this plot?”

function totalConfusion() { return true; }

But, hey, enough of my mental rambling. What's up with you? Hope you've had a less chaotic evening than my movie night full of overdone theatrics and obscure plot lines. 😂
